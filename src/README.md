# Mergington High School Activities API

A super simple FastAPI application that allows students to view and sign up for extracurricular activities.

## Features

- View all available extracurricular activities
- Sign up for activities
- Teacher authentication for registration management

## Getting Started

1. Install the dependencies:

   ```
   pip install fastapi uvicorn
   ```

2. Run the application:

   ```
   uvicorn src.app:app --reload
   ```

   Configure teacher credentials before starting the server. Generate a password
   hash with `python -c "from src.app import hash_password; print(hash_password('change-me'))"`,
   then create `teacher_credentials.json` outside source control:

   ```json
   {"teachers": [{"username": "teacher", "password_hash": "scrypt$..."}]}
   ```

   Set `TEACHER_CREDENTIALS_FILE` when the file is stored elsewhere.

3. Open your browser and go to:

## API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint                                                          | Description                                                         |
| ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |

| POST   | `/activities/{activity_name}/signup?email=student@mergington.edu` | Sign up for an activity                                             |

## Data Model

The application uses a simple data model with meaningful identifiers:

1. **Activities** - Uses activity name as identifier:

   - Description
   - Schedule
   - Maximum number of participants allowed
   - List of student emails who are signed up

2. **Students** - Uses email as identifier:
   - Name
   - Grade level

All data is stored in memory, which means data will be reset when the server restarts.
